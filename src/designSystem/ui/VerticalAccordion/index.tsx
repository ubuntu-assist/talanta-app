        <AccordionPanel>
          A UI (User Interface) component is a modular, reusable element that
          serves a specific function within a graphical user interface. Examples
          include buttons, input fields, dropdown menus, sliders, and
          checkboxes.

      <AccordionItem value='item-2'>
        <AccordionHeader icon={<Plus />}>
          Why are UI components important?
        </AccordionHeader>
        <AccordionPanel>
          UI components promote consistency, efficiency, and scalability in
          software development. They allow developers to reuse code, maintain a
          consistent look and feel across an application, and easily make
          updates or modifications without affecting the entire system.

        <AccordionHeader icon={<Plus />}>
          Key characteristics of UI components?
        </AccordionHeader>
        <AccordionPanel>
          Well-designed UI components should be modular, customizable, and
          accessible. They should have clear and intuitive functionality, be
          easily styled to match the overall design language of the application.
