                    warranties, including without limitation, implied warranties

                    likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials

                    In no event shall the School be liable for any damages
                    (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or
                    profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the
                    use or inability to use the materials on the School’s
                    website, even if the School or an authorized representative
                    of the School has been notified orally or in writing of the
                    possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do
                    not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations
                    of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these
                    limitations may not apply to you.
